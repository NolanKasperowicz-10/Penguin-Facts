They breed on many sub-Antarctic islands and on the Antarctic Peninsula. They generally occupy their islands all year round. The largest populations of gentoo penguins are in the Falkland Islands (South Georgia), and on the Antarctic Peninsula.", "The Little Penguin occurs only in Australia and New Zealand.

The breeding season runs from August to February.", "African penguins are found along coastal areas and offshore islands.
